          Imagine if your whole life was played out on a daily TV soap? Everyday you would see an intricate detailed, repetition of what is going to happen next in your life or has already happened. A clear copy of the same people around you, yet in appearances of actors? Crazy right?</p>

          <p>

Vikram Kumar’s horror/mystery film 13B truly makes you question the suspense and gets you thinking about certain, strange events. Starring Madhavan as Manohar or as they call him ‘Manu’ his life seems all too perfect, with a caring wife, loving family and a secure job. Though I spoke too soon. Strange events start happening to Manu, the lift not working, his photograph looking messed up and the house generally falling apart. But most of all a new TV soap which integrates a fairly different yet very familiar tale. A story of a family living in a new home, facing a list of events. Interestingly, this soap literally is a replica of Manu’s family, thus taking control of their lives. Unfolding dark secrets, Manu explores the past and digs deep to find out the truth. Though will he be able to save his family? Or will the soap continue its series?
</p>

<p>
A unique story told through a simple yet effective way. The strange effects gradually unfold, slowly releasing clues for the audience. But at the same time, leaving them filled with enigmas. The whole concept of a TV soap re-telling a real life story is enthralling and somewhat intriguing, making you think what if this happened to you? Everything is connected, the timing precise, the hints intact, along with mysterious clues where the Dog cautiously barks symbolizing a sense of ghosts and spirits.
